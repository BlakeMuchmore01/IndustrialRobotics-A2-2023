Two collaborative robots, or "cobots," will work together to improve the efficiency of managing a blackjack tabletop card game. 
This collaboration eliminates the trust issues that can arise with a human dealer. 
The code for this project will be divided into two main components:

1. Cobot Simulation: This component will simulate the actions and interactions of the two cobots as they manage the blackjack game.

2. User Interface (GUI): The user interface will allow users to control the simulation and interact with the cobots. 
Users will have the following functionalities:

    - Emergency Stop: Users can halt the simulation in case of any issues or emergencies.
    - Continue Simulation: Users can resume the simulation from where it was paused due to an emergency stop.
    - Teach Functionality: This feature enables users to instruct and program robot movements for specific tasks.
    - Blackjack Game: Users can engage in the typical processes involved in a blackjack game,

The cobots will undergo active collision avoidance when required within the active environment.
This will also include pausing the cobot's movement while unauthorised objects are within the unsafe zone.
